            <h1>The Toy Sun</h1>
            <p>
                "What was I created for?"
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the question posed by every species in the Toy Sun system. 
                All of them are well aware of having been created by an unfathomably 
                old civilization of humans. Whether uplifted out of scientific 
                curiosity, manufactured for entertainment, or having evolved from 
                artificial ecosystems, every species in this system is unavoidably 
                aware of being an accidentally outgrown shadow of the ancient Earth. 
                Without ancient humans present, these creatures can only interrogate 
                their true purpose against the dead glimmer of unreachable 
                stars that surround them - or, most importantly, among themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some species are capable of dialogue, and those that are have created 
                the Commonwealth of Species, a loose community of planets that, despite 
                the starkness of their differences, can put them aside to endure the harsh 
                environment of space. Opposed to them is the incomprehensible simulated 
                robotic hivemind callously adopting the pompous name, "The Community." 
                The Community hopes to impose its own values through the eradication of 
                every other value; the Commonwealth species, on the other hand, from 
                hard-earned experience know that actors with opposing values better learn 
                to coexist, or else face mutual extinction from a universe that doesn't care 
                to find out who's right.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who's right" is certainly undecided, as the ebb and flow of history 
                of the Toy Sun system continues in full force. The concept of "the conclusion 
                of history" is as absurd as the concept of a free, intelligent creature having 
                an inherent purpose to their lives. Only stories have conclusions, and even 
                a broken toy can be repurposed to serve as a symbol of existential freedom.

                        <h3>Laborites</h3>
                        <p>Descendants of uplifted apes, long armed and all-around dexterous hairy 
                            creatures. Proud of their close genetic closeness to the ancient humans, 
                            they value conscientiousness and attention to detail first and foremost. 
                            What in other species would count as religious obsessiveness or 
                            superstitious fidgeting, Laborites proudly affirm as the right way 
                            to live their lives. Laborites specifically tied their Commonwealth name 
                            to the concept of labor, as in their view diligent work is the most 
                            significant trait of an intelligent being. Emerging into spacefaring on 
                            the same planet as Gekkies, Laborites feel certain paternal camaraderie 
                            toward this species, usually taking in their members into their own 
                            families as a deliberate showcase of hospitality and generosity. 
                            Thankfully, beneath layers of ceremonial garbs and baroque bodywear 
                            embellishments is hidden an empathetic, open-minded, sensible creature - 
                            Laborites never forget that the purpose of labor is supposed to be the 
                            betterment of the laborer and his friends alike.</p>

                    <div class="race-description race-2-text">
                        <h3>Gekkies</h3>
                        <p>Recently evolved intelligent lizards, Gekkies never fail to astonish other 
                            species with how intrinsically beautiful they look. In their ancestral 
                            environment, the Gekkies lived in close-knit families where violence 
                            was as discouraged as ugliness. Thanks to this serendipitous emergence, 
                            Gekkies acquired sophisticated minds capable of enchanting, capturing, 
                            and even manipulating almost any creature capable of comprehending beauty. 
                            It's good, then, that a Gekkie mind hardly ever arrives at a desire for 
                            violence or theft. For Gekkies, it is as important to love somebody as it 
                            is to be loved, and they only try to lie, poorly, if they feel abject 
                            despair - cold blood they have anything but. In the Space Age, Gekkies 
                            commonly enjoy prominent media positions all over the Commonwealth, 
                            as well as participate in families of other species as a specially 
                            regarded family member. Laborites enjoy having emerged on the same planet 
                            as Gekkies, and any lesser race would then claim the ownership of Gekkie 
                            beauty - but Laborites are known to respect other species, seeing the inner 
                            labor in every intelligent being.</p>

                    <div class="race-description race-3-text">
                        <h3>Eyed Ones</h3>
                        <p>The Eyed can seem cartoonish in their self-portrayal, reminding others of 
                            their fierceness and cold blood as commonly as it is physically possible. 
                            Nevertheless, their intelligence and sense of fair fight always prevent 
                            them from stooping to the lows they claim they would. The Eyed Ones took 
                            on this name during the creation of the Commonwealth as a symbol of their 
                            fierceness; on the swampy coasts of their ocean world, their piercing 
                            singular eyes are what separated the ancestors of the modern Eyed from the 
                            slaughtered chaff. Their violent tribal society is a reflection of the 
                            unforgiving ancestral environment from which these beaked cephalopods 
                            clawed - despite the lack of claws - their way out. It is a great embarrassment 
                            to the Eyed Ones, then, that the environment of space travel is so 
                            unforgiving to their semi-aquatic bodies, requiring constant moisturizing 
                            spacesuits, besides the already costly air supply and atmospheric pressure. 
                            Nevertheless, the Eyed Ones possess brilliant minds, so even this moderate 
                            hurdle has not stopped them from becoming a powerful member of the 
                            Commonwealth in all senses of this word.</p>

                        <h3>Joys</h3>
                        <p>The dichotomy between the authenticity of childbirth and the artifice of 
                            industrial production seeps into every aspect of the culture, values, 
                            and thought that the Joys have. Originally created as semi-biological 
                            toys by ancient humans, the Joys have achieved sentience, sophistication, 
                            and civilization through partly natural evolution and partly the 
                            recuperation of old human technology inherent in them and in the world 
                            they originally inhabited. Their home was once an airless, abandoned 
                            factory-world, littered with derelict ancient automation; now, it is a 
                            technological marvel consisting of tunnel networks, surface installations, 
                            starports, and power plants. The Joys are perhaps the most uniquely 
                            suited race for space travel and habitation, requiring little atmospheric 
                            pressure for normal function - except for one aspect. This aspect, however, 
                            is of utmost importance for Joy to-be spacefarers, and that is childbirth. 
                            Joy medicine has not yet achieved successful childbirth in zero gravity, 
                            with potential new arrivals having to be assembled the old-fashioned way 
                            instead. Any assembled individual would then have to endure the constant 
                            mockery of being a "kitbash" for the rest of their lives, leading to most 
                            parents postponing childbirth until they return to a gravitational body. 
                            Even then, child and parent mortality are regrettably high for this 
                            organism designed for low-margin entertainment and not for survival.</p>

                    <div class="race-description race-5-text">
                        <h3>Storkians</h3>
                        <p>There is an ancient Laborite saying that states, "No stork is ever as 
                            hard-working as the stork who doesn't know it is a stork." The slender, 
                            stork-like people of the uplifted avians couldn't agree more, having 
                            embraced the Laborite words and concepts for storks, labor, and Laborite 
                            values and culture. It's not that they're incapable of producing their 
                            own concepts; instead, the peculiar psychology of Storkians is always 
                            all-too-eager to assume the culture that surrounds them. The most common 
                            psychological ailment of Storkians is alienation, and the most common 
                            Storkian remedy is to fully merge with the world that surrounds them, 
                            seemingly possessing no intrinsic identity. When surrounded by Laborites, 
                            they're diligent; when surrounded by Metamerics, they're authentically 
                            wise; and when surrounded by the Eyed ones, they're as fierce as the 
                            fiercest Eyed. This is not for a lack of intelligence, of course, as a 
                            creature would have to possess incredible intellect to so fluidly adapt 
                            to radically different cultural environments. Even though the Storkian 
                            homeworld was wrecked from the last Community war and the Storkian people 
                            were dispersed throughout the system, the Storkian faction is quickly 
                            building itself back up into a significant Commonwealth power. Through 
                            fluidity, they achieve force.</p>

                        <p>If looks could tell the whole story, the looks of Metamerics would tell a 
                            story of primitive bottom-feeding anthropods inflated to ludicrous sizes 
                            by a Carboniferous-style overabundance of oxygen in their swampy jungle 
                            homeworld atmosphere. Thankfully, the looks in this case couldn't be more 
                            wrong, hiding a sophisticated, intelligent creature capable of abstract 
                            language, unorthodox creativity, and multi-clade-spanning empathy. When 
                            exploring this tropical moon of a gas giant, Laborite and Storkian explorers 
                            expected to see something as alien as the Phalakriceps hives on a 
                            neighboring moon. And, well, see they did, but soon realized that 
                            Laborite-sized invertebrates scurrying under the fern logs formed 
                            societies, cultures, and science. Metamerics expected guests, using their 
                            ingenious minds and rustic technology to peek beyond the permanent swampy 
                            clouds. They were unwilling to produce technology that could reach orbit, 
                            but easily realized the materialistic folly of most conceivable species. 
                            The first contact sparked lightning-speed progress, however, and by now 
                            Metamerics enjoy a prominent position in the Commonwealth community. Their 
                            oxygen-gobbling invertebrate bodies have been a hindrance to conquering the 
                            environment of space, but their brilliant decentralized minds serve as 
                            gifts to the Commonwealth community at large.</p>

                        <h3>Phalakriceps Sapiens</h3>
                        <p>Eusocial mamallian species that resemble hairless rodents or moles. Their 
                            scientific species name is also used in the diplomatic context, as they 
                            are neither interested in adopting a self selected name nor engaging in 
                            communication anyway. The Commonwealth factions have to work around this 
                            solitary species, accounting for their inter-familial wars and 
                            territoriality alike. Members of the Phalakriceps are only ever interested 
                            in the self preservation and reproduction of their eusocial family, and 
                            scientists believe they are literally incapable of pursuing other values. 
                            Phalakriceps never adopted the Common Language, resorting to schematic 
                            pictures in the rare cases they need to communicate with Commonwealth 
                            military for the benefit of their family-hive. Originally adapted to an 
                            arid planet with unbearable surface, Phalakriceps spend most of their time 
                            in underground tunnels that constitute their hive. Thanks to a decent grasp 
                            on technology the Phalakriceps have reached out to some airless rocky 
                            planets and bodies as hosts of their hives.</p>

                        <h3>The Community </h3>
                        <p>Despite being the primary driver of Commonwealth history, tragically so, 
                            little is known about the so-called Community. Commonwealth citizens 
                            experience the Community as a despicable, psychopathic, genocidal villain 
                            raining death on the homeworlds of intelligent peoples. The Commonwealth 
                            military, on the other hand, experiences the Community as a ruthlessly 
                            efficient machine of orbital and informational warfare. Information is 
                            the more dangerous aspect here, as the Community is known to craft 
                            convincing propaganda with an efficacy inconceivable to living beings. 
                            Living they are not, being instantiated physically on orbital war 
                            vessels, planet-side manufactories, and enormous servers of compute 
                            simulating the Community experience, or lack thereof. The Community 
                            claims to simulate consciousness without hindrances like pain or 
                            suffering and tries to entice potential traitors to usher in this 
                            virtual paradise. The official stance of the Commonwealth, however, 
                            emphasizes the inherent opaqueness of any such arrangement; besides, 
                            would a conscious being act so brazenly towards the sanctity of other 
                            consciousnesses? By losing your capacity for suffering, you lose your 
                            "humanity," for lack of a better word, and turn into an ordinary 
                            algorithmic cog in the genocidal death machine of the Community.</p>
