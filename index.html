            <h1>The Toy Sun</h1>
            <p>
                "What was I created for?"
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the question posed by every species in the Toy Sun system. 
                All of them are well aware of having been created by an unfathomably 
                old civilization of humans. Whether uplifted out of scientific 
                curiosity, manufactured for entertainment, or having evolved from 
                artificial ecosystems, every species in this system is unavoidably 
                aware of being an accidentally outgrown shadow of the ancient Earth. 
                Without ancient humans present, these creatures can only interrogate 
                their true purpose against the dead glimmer of unreachable 
                stars that surround them - or, most importantly, among themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some species are capable of dialogue, and those that are have created 
                the Commonwealth of Species, a loose community of planets that, despite 
                the starkness of their differences, can put them aside to endure the harsh 
                environment of space. Opposed to them is the incomprehensible simulated 
                robotic hivemind callously adopting the pompous name, "The Community." 
                The Community hopes to impose its own values through the eradication of 
                every other value; the Commonwealth species, on the other hand, from 
                hard-earned experience know that actors with opposing values better learn 
                to coexist, or else face mutual extinction from a universe that doesn't care 
                to find out who's right.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Who's right" is certainly undecided, as the ebb and flow of history 
                of the Toy Sun system continues in full force. The concept of "the conclusion 
                of history" is as absurd as the concept of a free, intelligent creature having 
                an inherent purpose to their lives. Only stories have conclusions, and even 
                a broken toy can be repurposed to serve as a symbol of existential freedom.
